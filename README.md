# RITONAVIR-Model
The whole-body PBPK model for ritonavir, a potent time-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A4.

## Repository files
Within this repository, we distribute a whole-body PBPK model of ritonavir, encompassing competitive and time-dependent inhibition and induction effects of CYP3A4 by ritonavir. The model was assessed using observed data on ritonavir pharmacokinetics and its interactions with midazolam, triazolam, and oxycodone. The detailed information on model development and evaluation was described in [1].
